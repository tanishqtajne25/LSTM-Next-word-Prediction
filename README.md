Next Word Prediction with LSTM and Streamlit

This project is a Next Word Prediction Web App built with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and deployed using Streamlit.
It predicts the most probable next word given a sequence of words, leveraging a trained LSTM model with early stopping.

Features

Predicts the next word in a sequence

Built using TensorFlow/Keras LSTM

Uses a trained tokenizer for word-to-index mapping

Simple Streamlit UI for real-time predictions
